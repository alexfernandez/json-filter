# json-filter

A high-performance web server that parses the JSON payload and redirects requests to a different server.

## API

The JSON filter can be used in your code using the very simple API.
First install locally:

First run `npm install` to get all dependencies:

    $ npm install

Or add to the dependencies of your `package.json`.
Then start the filter from your code, for instance:

```
var jsonFilter = require('json-filter');
var options = {
    port: 8080,
    destination: 'localhost:55500',
    passRequest: function(message)
    {
        // process request
        return true;
    },
    passResponse: function(message)
    {
        // process response
        return true;
    },
};
jsonFilter.start(options, function(error)
{
    if (error)
    {
        console.error('Could not start JSON filter: %s', error);
    }
});
```

### `jsonFilter.start(options, callback)`

This function receives an object with options and a callback, and starts a JSON filter server.
The server will receive HTTP requests, and will relay to a backend server only those requests
for which the `options.passRequest` function returns `true`.
When the response comes from the backend server it will be relayed back to the caller only if
the `options.passResponse` returns `true`. In any other case the caller will receive an
HTTP 204 "No Content" response.

#### `options` object

The following attributes are required:

* `port`: the port to start the server on.
* `destination`: backend to send the filtered messages.
* `passRequest(message)`: a function that will receive the complete parsed request
and return `true` if the message passes the filter; otherwise an HTTP 204 response
will be sent back to the caller.
* `passResponse(message)`: a function that will receive the complete parsed response
and return `true` if the message passes the filter; otherwise an HTTP 204 response
will be sent back to the caller.

#### `callback`: `function(error) {...}`

A function that will be called with `error` if the server could not be started.

#### `pass(message)`

A function that receives a complete message, and returns true if it passes the filter.
Otherwise the caller will receive an HTTP 204 response. Both `options.passRequest`
and `options.passResponse` have this same structure.

The message has the following attributes:

* `startLine`: the first line of an HTTP request or response. Example:
`GET / HTTP/1.1`.
* `headers`: a map of headers as key-value.
* `body`: the body of the message as a string.
* `json`: if the MIME type of the request is `application/json`,
this attribute will contain the parsed JSON.

## Binary Usage

The JSON filter can be started using binary scripts.
As before, frst run `npm install` to get all dependencies:

    $ npm install

Then try starting the noContent server and the JSON filter server from two different consoles:

    $ node bin/noContent.js
    $ node bin/filter.js

By default the `noContent` server starts in the 55500 port,
while the `filter` server starts on the 55501 port and redirects everything to the 55500 port.

### `filter` Options

The `filter` server has some runtime options.

#### `--port` or `-p _port_`

Start the `filter` server on the given port (by default 55500).

#### `--destination` or `-d _server_:_port_`

Send the filtered requests to the given destination, as `_server_:_port_`.

#### `--cluster` or `-c`

Start the `filter` server in cluster mode, so that it has a process per core on the server.

#### Example

    $ node bin/filter -c -p 8080 -d localhost:55500

Starts the `filter` server in cluster mode, on port 8080 and redirecting to local port 55500.

### `noContent` Options

The `noContent` server also has a couple of runtime options.

#### `--cluster` or `-c`

Start the `noContent` server in cluster mode, so that it has a process per core on the server.

#### `--delay` or `-d _ms_`

Delay each request for the given number of milliseconds.
This options is particularly interesting to check if a filter server responds fast
even if the backend is somehow laggy.

#### Example

    $ node bin/noContent.js -c -d 30

Starts the `noContent` server in cluster mode and with a delay of 30 ms.

## Load tests

If you want to check the speed of the filter server, just run one of the provided load test scripts.
You can use [Apache ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html):

    $ bash/ab.sh

Or alternatively [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)

    $ bash/wrk.sh
